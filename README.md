A tool for analyzing query performance and building data lineage graphs from PostgreSQL databases.

## Features

- Identify the most expensive queries in your PostgreSQL database
- Build data lineage graphs showing how data flows between tables
- Analyze table usage statistics
- Get performance insights and optimization recommendations
- Export results in various formats (CSV, PNG, GraphML)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database with `pg_stat_statements` extension enabled
- Required Python packages (installed automatically):
  - Flask
  - psycopg2
  - pandas
  - networkx
  - matplotlib
  - sqlparse
  - waitress

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install pg_lineagelens
```

Then run the application:

```bash
# Basic usage (starts server and opens browser)
pg_lineagelens

# Show help and available options
pg_lineagelens --help

# Run on a specific port
pg_lineagelens --port 8080

# Run on a specific host (e.g., to allow external connections)
pg_lineagelens --host 0.0.0.0

# Run without opening browser automatically
pg_lineagelens --no-browser

# Show version
pg_lineagelens --version
```

### Option 2: Install from source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somasays/pg_lineagelens.git
cd pg_lineagelens
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app_launcher.py
```

## Setting up pg_stat_statements in PostgreSQL

To use this tool, you need to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension in your PostgreSQL database:

1. Edit your `postgresql.conf` file and add:
   ```
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
   pg_stat_statements.track = all
   ```

2. Restart PostgreSQL

3. Connect to your database and run:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Enter your PostgreSQL connection details
3. Configure the analysis settings
4. Run the analysis
5. Explore the results:
   - View expensive queries
   - Examine table statistics
   - Visualize data lineage
   - Download reports

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pipenv (optional, for development)

### Build and Publish

To build the Python package:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build both wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# Check the built package
twine check dist/*

# Upload to TestPyPI (optional, for testing)
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

# Upload to PyPI (when ready for release)
twine upload dist/*
```

Or use the provided script:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build_and_publish.sh

# Run the build script
./build_and_publish.sh
```

### Using Pipenv (Optional)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pipenv install
pipenv install --dev

# Run with pipenv
pipenv run python app_launcher.py
```

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases.

### Automated Package Publishing

Every new tag with version format (v*) triggers the PyPI publishing workflow which:
- Builds the Python package (source and wheel)
- Verifies the package contents
- Publishes the package to PyPI

### Creating Releases

1. Tag a commit with a version number:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. This will trigger the build workflow and automatically:
   - Build and publish the Python package to PyPI
   - Create a GitHub release

### Manual Publishing

You can also manually trigger the publishing workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.
